# PCOS-Follicle-Detection
Deep Learning model for PCOS follicle detection and classification using ultrasound images.

# PCOS Follicle Detection using Deep Learning
This project focuses on the detection and classification of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) from ultrasound images using deep learning.
It applies advanced image preprocessing (Gaussian filtering, histogram equalization, Watershed segmentation) and transfer learning techniques (e.g., VGG16, CNN) to count follicles and differentiate between PCOS and non-PCOS cases.

# Features
Preprocessing pipeline to enhance ultrasound images
Follicle segmentation using Watershed and contour detection
Transfer learning with pre-trained CNN models
Follicle countâ€“based classification for PCOS diagnosis
Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

# Technologies Used
Python (NumPy, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib)
Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
Deep Learning & Image Processing

# Goal
To assist medical professionals in identifying PCOS patterns in ovarian ultrasound images through automated and explainable AI analysis.
